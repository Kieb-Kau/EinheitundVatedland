All in one month, their Prime Minster was assassinated, The House of Common was almost destroyed by a bomb, killing most of their staff, a revolution rose up on Ireland, and most important of all, the entire royal family were killed in a hostage crisis in Buckingham Palace, leaving the 'United Kingdom' without a Monarchy. The case for all of those events are still left open as the people who done of those event are left unknown, one thing is be sure though, it broke Britainnia’s Heart."
